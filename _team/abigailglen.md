Abi completed her doctorate in pre-1550s English Literature at Clare College, Cambridge; her main research interests are Animal Studies, medieval visual culture and the portrayal of minority groups. During her PhD, Abi interned in the Department of Manuscripts and Printed Books at the Fitzwilliam, producing bestiary catalogue entries for the Cambridge Illuminations Research Project.  Abi is also an academic collaborator on CARNEVALE, an interdisciplinary project on pig intelligence and play based at the Edinburgh College of Art and the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. From 2009-14 BC (Before Cambridge) she undertook the MA and MPhil in English Language at the University of Glasgow.   In past lives, she has been a feminist writer, a gin distiller, a dog-walker and an entirely mediocre lounge singer. She is only ever one bad decision away from performing stand-up.
