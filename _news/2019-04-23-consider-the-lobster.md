I live by the rule that Everything Is Copy (the late, great Nora Ephron, of course). Singed off your hair while recording a beauty tutorial? Copy. Dissolution of your lukewarm Starter Marriage after six months? Copy. Asked to 3D model a gently rotting lobster as part of a mock-Baroque feast? Copy. See, you’re reading it right now.

As a consequence, I agree to a lot of things, mostly because I think they’ll be funny later. In the case of the lobster, though, it was both amusing and useful; part of the fellowship is to acquire a glut of digi-skills, including photogrammetry and 3D modelling. Even better that our charge for the day, Mr. Pinchy (yeah I named him, what of it) was a challenge: crenellated, articulated, mottled, and perched on a pewter plate.

I should point out that Mr. Pinchy had already been hob-nobbing, in his crustaceous way, with the photographers for 36 hours before Jen and I arrived. He looked great, but he … well, he smelled like the end of the day. Nonetheless, we persisted. Dan advised me to get as many photos as we could for the processing to be successful, so I put aside my natural impatience and attempted to get MP from every angle (I resisted calling out encouragement to my model, but I can’t promise I didn’t internally shout ‘the clam-era loves you, baby’). I was pointing and shooting in arcs overhead while Jen wielded the SLR like David Bailey in a nice frock.

This week’s task will be to run the hundreds of photographs we took through our processing software, and hopefully be rewarded with a 3D model we can print; a new meaning to Snappy Snaps, indeed.
