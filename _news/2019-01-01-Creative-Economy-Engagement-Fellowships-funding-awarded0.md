The Fitzwilliam Museum is pleased to announce that it has received funding from
the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) for circa Â£252,000 (FEC) to host
4 talented Early Career Researchers (ECR) on Post Doctoral Fellowships. This new
project is led by Daniel Pett, the museum's head of Digital and IT, and Dr Jo Vine
the museum's Research Co-ordinator.

The Museum will be working in partnership with two Creative Economy partners to
interrogate the use of digital 3D derivations and interventions within the context
of the museum. The Fitzwilliam Museum is fortunate to work with two small and sector
leading enterprises who are at the cutting edge of working with 3D assets.

Museum in a Box, led by George Oates, are based in London and will be working with
Dr Abi Glen and Dr Jennifer Wexler on two distinct projects that may interact with
forthcoming exhibitions and interventions in the Museum space.

ThinkSee3D, led by Steve Dey, are based in Eynsham, Oxfordshire and will be working
with Dr Catriona Cooper (policy based) and Dr Melanie Pitkin (Egyptian coffins) to produce
much needed resources for the University of Cambridge Museums.

This is just the beginning of the Fitzwilliam Museum's journey into the world of 3D.
