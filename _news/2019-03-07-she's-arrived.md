Regular readers round here will know how exciting I find post. Any kind of post--- letters, cards, receipts, forms, cardboard boxes, the New York Post, wooden dowels as part of 5-bar fences. I am equal opportunities for post. A Mail/Female Affirmative Action supporter. 

So you can imagine the unbridled joy at receiving an actual brown paper package tied up with string containing our first-ever Box:

She’s had quite the journey. From Hoxton to the British Museum (ably received by Jen’s husband, Sam) to Islington to Cambridge, and now ready for a close-up. The Perspex boxes come in a CMYK colour-way. I knew we’d be taking the box to a wide range of outreach groups, and didn’t want it to be too obviously gendered (and they’d run out of black). So Pandora’s the exact colour of a daffodil---- cheerful, distinctive, pleasingly squat.

She’s looking at me expectantly while I write this, given the slew of visitors we had yesterday. Today I’ll take her up to Finance (nothing to do with the fact they sign off my expenses--- they are a bunch of fiercely smart and curious women who love to know about the latest research in the museum). Next up will be a meeting with Education to talk about our plans for outreach to hospitals, and then to Vicky Avery to show her the possibilities for a digital space in the Food exhibition.

If you’re nearby and fancy a demo, let me know via @abilglen or the form below.
