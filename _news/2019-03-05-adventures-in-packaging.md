CEEF News 4: Packaging 
The Guardian thinks that having hanging baskets is the sign <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/mar/04/a-beautiful-hanging-basket-and-six-other-signs-youve-mastered-adulthood">sign</a> you’ve mastered adulthood.
Flowers and flossing are all very well, but the true measure that your childhood is over is when you literally skip to pick up a delivery of cardboard boxes. That’s right. I got a genuine kick of joy at the thought of a cardboard box filled with other, smaller cardboard boxes.

We’ve been insistent that we’ll use sustainable and recyclable materials as far as possible for this project. Lil Packaging is one of the biggest packaging suppliers in the UK, are coincidentally just up the road, and are about the only company of its kind approved by the Forest Council. We wanted some kraftpaper/brown cardboard to keep with that handmade #aesthetic the <Cambridge Art Makers> are working on. 
Sadly Lil had run out of these, so we ordered a selection of sprauncy carriers and plain white pizza boxes instead. I had the world’s lamest Goldilocks moment playing with them. In case you’re interested, a taxonomy of the order: 
  
Style	Colour	Thoughts & Comments	Likely Contents	Marks /5.0
SL0+Letterbox
	White	Mini version of the SL2, below. Rectangular pizza box style.	That guy who did film with you made a zine about sneakers and spent a lot of money on VistaPrint making promo stickers. Soon to be found on Bristol lampposts.	3.5. Played ball but  just too small. 
iSL3 Breezebox	Brown Kraft	Glue came unstuck instantly. Fiddly construction. Weird rubberised layer of paper inside. 4x as expensive as the others; 4x as annoying to work with. Sounds familiar.	Pretentious eBay seller ripping you off for a Vogue Italia from 1997. 	0.Annoyed it broke instantly, and felt cheap despite being expensive.
SL180 –Mailbox 2	White	The ‘pizza baby box’. Jen took a shine to it. She’s welcome to him: he’s too titchy for our needs. 	A gummy pizza from Poundland.	4. Purely for cuteness factor-- it’s about as useful as a case sensitive search engine.
SL2-343-Mailbox 3	White*	*Except came with smudged bootmarks on it.
Classic letterbox-box. No bells, whistles or other singing hardware.	Maybe, if we can get it in kraftpaper…the Food Collection.	4. Glow up and we can talk.

Does anybody have any suggestions for sustainable and reasonably priced packaging? Or maybe something better for me to do with my time. Either way, send us a note on the Contact Us form below, or tweet @abilglen.
