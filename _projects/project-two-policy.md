You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and... Why so serious?

Perhaps you should read the instructions first?

Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.

All creatures feel fear. Especially the scary ones.

I've sewn you up, I've set your bones, but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members in the Wayne family.

You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.

This isn't a car.
