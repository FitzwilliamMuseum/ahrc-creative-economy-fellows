Museum in a Box is an edtech startup based in Hoxton, in London. It started its
life as one of a series of R&D projects coming out of Good, Form & Spectacle in
London. We incorporated in October 2015, after being so buoyed by reactions to
the idea.

Weâ€™re a small team based in London and Liverpool, supported by a much wider crew
of advisors, talented students and supporters.
