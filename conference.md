**Do Not Touch: 3D in Museums**

Date: 3rd June 2019
Location: [Judge Business School, University of Cambridge](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/)
Time: 9:30am - 4:30pm
Tickets: £15 waged/£5 non-waged

Join the [University of Cambridge Museums](https://www.museums.cam.ac.uk/) for a one-day conference about 3D technology and tactile access to heritage collections. We’ll be exploring how 3D modelling and printing technology can be used to open up collections to everyone.

The aim is to bring together people from the heritage sector – including conservators, curators, educators and digital specialists – with university researchers and representatives from the creative and digital industries, exploring how 3D modelling and printing technology can be utilised effectively to open up collections to everyone.

Within the heritage sector, we want to increase interdisciplinary and cross-sector discussions around increasing accessibility to the collections, whilst ensuring that we are taking our responsibility for the objects in our care seriously.

Speakers will specialise in 3D technologies, conservation, learning, outreach and research.  A particular area of interest for us is around how interventions could be replicated in other settings and bringing together different voices to establish how this might work.

The conference is co-organised by the [CEEF](https://creative-economy.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/) and [Do Not Touch](https://do-not-touch.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/) Projects, in collaboration with the [Fitzwilliam Museum](https://fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk) and our two industrial collaborators - [Museum in a Box](/partners/museuminabox/) and [ThinkSee3D](/partners/thinksee3d/).

This project  is generously funded by the [Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://ahrc.ukri.org/) (AHRC)
