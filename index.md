This project brings together three key actors in the heritage ecosystem: a university, a museum
and industrial collaborators. When combined they provide three essential perspectives that will
enable us to choose and drive forward four early career researcher (ECR) projects that will lead to
enhanced collaborations that benefit the creative economy. The efficacy of this type of partnership
can be developed during this project to refine engagement models for the future. A particular
challenge for businesses selling into the cash-strapped heritage industry is access to customers; in
this project the Fitzwilliam will be in the unique position of being both a research partner
and the provider of invaluable input as a potential customer/end user for heritage industry
products.

By providing a shared base within a museum and through partnership with
industrial collaborators, the researchers will benefit from exposure to two new contexts in which their
research could be used. The ECRs will also be able to apply their expertise to a live challenge
and foster cross-sectoral information sharing and awareness-raising both during this project and
in their future careers. TS3D and MiaB are innovators in joining heritage with digital. The chosen
Industry collaborators bring distinct services, IP and research backgrounds to this
partnership. ThinkSee3D (TS3D) provides high-quality, research-led digital and physical 3D making
services for heritage, education, science, art and research. They are a team of dedicated makers,
creating and exploring the boundaries between digital and physical model making, using modern
and traditional methods to create engaging digital and physical objects.

TS3D have a long history of working with national, local and international museums including the British Museum and the
Victoria and Albert. Museum in a Box (MiaB) aim to put museum collections and expert
knowledge into audiences’ hands wherever they are in the world. A Museum in a Box is a small
acrylic or plywood Box with a Raspberry Pi and RFID technology inside. It comes with a Collection
of objects – 3D prints, postcards, documents; anything you can pick up and touch – and can be sent
anywhere in the world, delivering a multi-sensory handling collection experience. MiaB have worked
with the British Museum and the Smithsonian and have delivered a wide variety of projects for the
sector.
