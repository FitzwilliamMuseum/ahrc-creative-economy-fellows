This project generously funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)
brings together three key actors in the heritage ecosystem:

* a university
* a museum
* two industrial collaborators - [Museum in a Box]({{ site.baseurl }}partners/museuminabox/)
and [ThinkSee3D]({{ site.baseurl }}partners/thinksee3d/).

When combined they provide three essential perspectives that will enable us to
choose and drive forward four early career researcher (ECR) projects that will
lead to enhanced collaborations that benefit the creative economy.

The efficacy of this type of partnership can be developed during this project to
refine engagement models for the future. A particular challenge for businesses
selling into the cash-strapped heritage industry is access to customers; in this
project the Fitzwilliam Museum will be in the unique position of being both a
research partner and the provider of invaluable input as a potential customer/end
user for heritage industry products.

By providing a shared base within a museum and through partnership with industrial
collaborators, the researchers will benefit from exposure to two new contexts in which their
research could be used. The ECRs will also be able to apply their expertise to a live challenge
and foster cross-sectoral information sharing and awareness-raising both during this project and
in their future careers.

Our partners bring very unique skillsets to the Museum. ThinkSee3D and Museum in
a Box are innovators in joining heritage with digital. This site will document our
2019 journey of collaborations, events and products.
